# Terraform Provider: Assert

The [Assert Terraform provider]((https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bschaatsbergen/assert/latest/docs)) is intended for use when writing [Terraform tests](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests). It serves as a way to verify that the values in your Terraform configuration meet specific criteria. The provider only contains functions to assert values, and does not manage any resources.

## Usage

## Terraform Test

```hcl
run "ebs_volume_size" {

  command = plan

  assert {
    condition     = provider::assert::between(1, 100, aws_ebs_volume.example.size)
    error_message = "EBS volume size must be between 1 and 100 GiB"
  }
}
```

## Variable Validation

```hcl
variable "ebs_volume_size" {
  type = number
  validation {
    condition     = provider::assert::between(1, 100, aws_ebs_volume.example.size)
    error_message = "EBS volume size must be between 1 and 100 GiB"
  }
}
```

## Documentation, questions and discussions

Official documentation on how to use this provider can be found on the 
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bschaatsbergen/assert/latest/docs).
In case of specific questions or discussions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bschaatsbergen/terraform-provider-assert/issues/new) in this repository.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.21)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) (optional)

## Development

### Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory
2. `make` will trigger the Golang build

The provided `GNUmakefile` defines additional commands generally useful during development,
like for running tests, generating documentation, code formatting and linting.
Taking a look at it's content is recommended.

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can run

* `make test` to run provider tests
* `make testacc` to run provider acceptance tests

It's important to note that acceptance tests (`testacc`) will actually spawn
`terraform` and the provider. Read more about they work on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests).

### Generating documentation

This provider uses [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/)
to generate documentation and store it in the `docs/` directory.
Once a release is cut, the Terraform Registry will download the documentation from `docs/`
and associate it with the release version. Read more about how this works on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).

Use `make generate` to ensure the documentation is regenerated with any changes.

### Using a development build

If [running tests and acceptance tests](#testing) isn't enough, it's possible to set up a local terraform configuration
to use a development builds of the provider. This can be achieved by leveraging the Terraform CLI
[configuration file development overrides](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

First, use `make install` to place a fresh development build of the provider in your
[`${GOBIN}`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies)
(defaults to `${GOPATH}/bin` or `${HOME}/go/bin` if `${GOPATH}` is not set). Repeat
this every time you make changes to the provider locally.

Then, setup your environment following [these instructions](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/debugging#terraform-cli-development-overrides)
to make your local terraform use your local build.

## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, and it's defined in the Workflow
[release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

Each release is cut by pushing a [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/) tag to the default branch.
