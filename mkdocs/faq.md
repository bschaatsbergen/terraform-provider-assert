## My PR hasn't been merged and it now has merge conflicts/failed checks, should I keep it up to date?

We realize that sometimes pull requests sit for a considerable amount of time without being addressed. During this time period they may accumulate merge conflicts and failed linter checks as the provider codebase moves forward. As maintainers we have no expectation that you keep your PR up to date, these issues will be addressed at review time most often by the maintainers themselves. Obviously we would hope that your PR is mergeable when first raised! The mergeability of the PR does not affect its prioritization for review.

## How often do you release?

If there's new functionality or bug fixes, we aim to release every week. If there are no changes, we will not release. We aim to release on a Tuesday or Wednesday, but this can vary depending on the complexity of the changes.

## How can I help?

Great question, if you have contributed before check out issues with the `help-wanted` label. These are normally enhancement issues that will have a great impact, but the maintainers are unable to develop them in the near future. If you are just getting started, take a look at issues with the `good-first-issue` label. Items with these labels will always be given priority for response.
